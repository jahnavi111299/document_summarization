Waste Management in India is overseen by the Union Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change. Rules regarding waste management are based on "sustainable development," "precaution," and "polluter pays." Cities and businesses are required to act responsibly and take care of the environment, fixing any harm they cause. India produces 62 million tonnes of waste annually, with 70% collected, and only 12 million tonnes treated, while 31 million tonnes end up in landfills. The generation of municipal solid waste is expected to rise to 165 million tonnes by 2030 due to changing consumption patterns and rapid economic growth. Challenges in managing waste include rapid urbanization, e-waste generation, lack of adequate garbage collection infrastructure, and a significant increase in waste generation. Only 21 million garbage collectors are compared to China's 700 million. Sorting recyclable materials is also a problem, as only 30% of waste is properly sorted, leading valuable materials like aluminum and plastics to end up into landfills instead of being recycled.
