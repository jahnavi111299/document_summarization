The documentary "Hot Coffee Reflection" presents a critical analysis and discussion about tort reform in the United States, highlighting how different cases have been misused or used to promote it. The film provides insights into how corporations and their insurers have exploited civil juries to support or defeat tort reform. The documentary teaches the public about the consequences of tort reform policies and laws and encourages citizens to protect their rights. It reminds the viewer of the controversial McDonald's Coffeecase, which explains how giant corporations use uncouth behaviors in order to succeed, and how corporations will always win unless the government offers an immediate solution. More documentaries and journal entries will inform more people about this looming problem.
