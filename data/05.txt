The relationship between the child’s behavior and the family setup depends on the parent who is caring, and the environmental factors coordinate with the genetic factors or catalyze them. The behavior of an indivual is influenced by three factors, including psychotic measures, extravert, and neurotics, in a theory referred to as the “PEN model”. Traits in children correlate with low levels of brain arousal, low interest, poor attention, poor observation techniques, and sleepiness. The right mind and environment are what it takes to create a behaviour and perso nality that lacks antisocial and illegal behaviours.
