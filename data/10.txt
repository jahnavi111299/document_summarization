Plate tectonics is a theory in science that describes movements on Earth's surface, including the lithosphere, which is made up of large broken rock masses suspended on the molten asthenosphere. Divergent plate movements occur when two oceanic plates move away from each other to form new oceanic crust at a zone of divergence, while convergent plate movements result from collision between two plates and continental or oceanic plate movements. The movement of these plates is facilitated by the fact that they float on the Earthâ€™s melted magma on the region called asthnosphere and cause earthquakes. The lateral plate slipping form of movement is the one that causes earthquakes around the world.
