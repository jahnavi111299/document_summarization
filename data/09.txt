The process of the water cycle involves recycling elements, evaporation, precipitation, run-off, and percolation. The water cycle is important in maintaining the right amount of water in nature, facilitating storage of underground water, and driving the movement of water from water bodies into the atmosphere in form of water vapor. The process involves several steps, including evapotranspiration, condensation, and precipitation. Precipitation is the main route through which water returns to the earth surface after the process of condensation. Water infiltrates into the ground, evaporates or flows back into water bodies, and replenishes ground-water aquifers. Groundwater moves further downwards intothe ground surface and remains trapped in the ground for thousands of years.
