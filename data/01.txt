Illicit drug use is a major social problem that has significant impacts on both the social and economic aspects of any country. The recent liberalization of trade has led to the growth of international trade, but it has also provided an opportunity for organized gangs to engage in drug trafficking on a global scale. Drug trafficking causes significant consequences on the health and financial systems of a country, including increased drug-related crime, decreased labor productivity, and decreased productivity. Addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine affects the general health of the users, withdiseases such as HIV/AID S being prevalent in drug injectors. Environmental damage is also a contributing factor, and drug addiction contributes to increased robbery and prostitution. Many resources are allocated to law enforcement officers to fight these vices at the expense of other sectors of the economy.
