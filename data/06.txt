The Olympic Games have negative impacts on both the host countries and athletes, including environmental destruction, air pollution, health challenges, evictions, congestion, rising land-rent value, and social implications such as the diversion of lottery funding towards the event. The focus on monetary gain has deprived the Olympic Games of its competitive nature and fairness, leading to unequal completion and rulings in case of disputes.
